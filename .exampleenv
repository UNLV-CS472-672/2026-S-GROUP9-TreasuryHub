# In your local repository, you will create a .env.local file. It should have the following two lines:
# These keys can be uploaded, which is why I have included them in the example, 
# however later down the line we will be adding more secret keys to the .env.local file, therefore you need to have this setup.
# It is already in the gitignore, so your .env.local should never be uploaded to github
